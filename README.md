# AI Robot Tank Design 
This repo presents my course project for EECE592: a powerful AI robot tank which achieves 90% winning rate in the game Robocode. The reinforcement learning algorithm and neural networks used in this project was developed in Java from scratch and didn't use any framework. It was a good practice for me on Java programming and AI learning system.  

[**Robocode**:](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/)

Robocode is a programming game where the goal is to code a robot to compete against other robots in a battle arena.
